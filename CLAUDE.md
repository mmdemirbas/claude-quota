# claude-quota

Compact statusline plugin for Claude Code showing full usage quota breakdown.

## Project Structure

```
src/
├── index.ts        # Entry point — reads stdin, orchestrates, calls render
├── types.ts        # All type definitions (StdinData, UsageData, etc.)
├── stdin.ts        # Parse JSON stdin from Claude Code
├── credentials.ts  # Read OAuth credentials (macOS Keychain + file fallback)
├── usage.ts        # Fetch api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage + file-based cache
├── git.ts          # Git branch and dirty status
├── ansi.ts         # ANSI-aware string utilities (visibleLength, truncate)
├── terminal.ts     # Terminal dimension resolution (stderr TTY → env vars → defaults)
├── render.ts       # ANSI status line rendering (width + height adaptive)
└── dashboard.ts    # Single-page HTML dashboard generator (--dashboard flag)
```

## Build & Test

```bash
./run build            # tsc → dist/
./run test             # compile test build + run all unit tests
./run stdin            # pipe mock JSON to test output
./run install          # build + npm link (makes global claude-quota binary point here)
./run release [patch]  # bump version, build, test, commit, push, tag → triggers npm publish
```

## How the Plugin Works

1. Claude Code invokes `node dist/index.js` as a subprocess, piping context JSON on stdin
2. Plugin reads OAuth token from macOS Keychain (`/usr/bin/security find-generic-password`)
3. Calls `GET api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage` with Bearer token
4. Parses ALL response fields (five_hour, seven_day, seven_day_sonnet, seven_day_opus, extra_usage)
5. Fetches prepaid credit balance via profile + credit grant APIs (separate caches)
6. Caches responses in `~/.claude/plugins/claude-quota/` (usage: 2 min hard / 45 s soft TTL; profile: 24 h; credit grant: 10 min; multi-instance aware — bumps timestamp before fetch to prevent parallel fetches)
7. Renders 1–3 lines to stdout (adaptive to terminal height and width)
8. Writes `dashboard.html` to the plugin dir (auto-refreshes every 5s via meta tag; open once with `! open ~/.claude/plugins/claude-quota/dashboard.html`)

## Key Design Decisions

- **Adaptive height layout**:
  - rows ≥ 3: three-line layout — line 1 = context (model, ctx, project, git); line 2 = plan + 5h + 7d; line 3 = fetch time + sonnet + opus + extra usage
  - rows = 2: two-line — line 1 unchanged; line 2 flattens all quotas (plan + 5h + 7d + snt + ops + $)
  - rows = 1: single line — model + compact ctx% + 5h% + 7d% (no bars, no git)
- **Adaptive width layout**: each line independently degrades through four detail tiers until it fits, with hard truncation as final safety net:
  - full (≥32 chars/quota): bar + pct + pace glyph + projected% + reset timer
  - no-reset (25): drop reset timers
  - no-pace (19): drop pace glyph + projected%
  - compact (9): drop bar, show label + pct only
- **Terminal dimensions**: resolved from `process.stderr` (stays TTY when stdout is piped) → `$COLUMNS`/`$LINES` env vars → defaults (120×3)
- **Pace indicators**: each quota shows current%, directional glyph (↘/→/↗), and projected end-of-window utilization
- **Bar coloring**: filled `█` up to pace is dim; over-pace `█` uses full severity color so excess stands out as actual usage. Empty `░` chars are coloured by outcome — dim for projected-to-be-consumed, gray for wasted quota (projected < 100%), red when quota will run out (projected ≥ 100%)
- **Window-progress glyph**: `○◔◑◕●` replaces `↺` in the reset slot, showing how far into the quota window the current time is (20% steps per glyph)
- **Fixed-width columns**: all quota segments (label, bar, value, pace, reset/limit) use the same char widths so glyphs align across lines
- **Fetch time**: `fetchedAt` stored in `UsageData`, rendered as `⟳HH:MM` in the col-0 of line 3 (exact local time, not relative — stays accurate without per-second refresh)
- **Full API parsing**: unlike claude-hud, we parse seven_day_sonnet, seven_day_opus, extra_usage
- **Credit grant balance**: fetches prepaid credit balance from `/api/oauth/organizations/{orgUUID}/overage_credit_grant` (org UUID from `/api/oauth/profile`). Shown as `($XX.XX)` after the extra usage segment. Both are independently cached with long TTLs since they change rarely.
- **File-based cache**: process is short-lived (~300ms per render), so no in-memory cache. Three cache files: `.usage-cache.json` (usage), `.profile-cache.json` (org UUID), `.credit-grant-cache.json` (credit grant)
- **Multi-instance safety**: before fetching usage, the cache timestamp is bumped to prevent parallel Claude instances from all hitting the API simultaneously
- **Rate-limit resilience**: on 429, show last-good data with ⟳ indicator + exponential backoff

## Conventions

- TypeScript strict mode
- ES modules (type: "module" in package.json)
- No external runtime dependencies — only node built-ins
- ANSI escape codes for colors (no chalk/picocolors)
